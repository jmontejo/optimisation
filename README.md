For the usage of this optimisation code, one has to follow only few steps

1) setup ATLAS and ROOT (the setup.sh script will most probable only work in Wuppertal)
2) define everything in the configuration file (more details below)
3) "python optimsation.py config.py"
4) you will get some output during the optimisation and also for the final cuts
